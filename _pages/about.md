<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). 
I received my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/).

My research area includes Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, and Accessible Computing.
I am interested in designing and building AI-powered intelligent user interfaces to provide better human-computer interaction experience to users.
